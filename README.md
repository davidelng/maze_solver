# Maze Solver in Python

This is a project from the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) curriculum.

It generates a maze with a Depth First algorithm into a tkinter GUI and then the maze solves itself using a Breadth First algorithm.

## How to use it

- Clone the repository on your local machine
- Make sure that python and tkinter are installed
- run `main.sh` from the project root

A new window should open and you should see a random maze generating and then solving itself.

## Tests

Run `test.sh` from the project root to run tests.
