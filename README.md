# Maze Solver in Python

This is a project from the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) curriculum.

It generates a maze with a Depth First algorithm into a tkinter GUI and then the maze solves itself using a Breadth First algorithm.

## How to use it

- Clone the repository on your local machine
- Make sure that python and tkinter are installed
- run `main.sh` from the project root

A new window should open and you should see a random maze generating and then solving itself.

## Tests

Run `test.sh` from the project root to run tests.

## Ideas for extending the project

- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A\*
- Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
- Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- Make it a game where the user chooses directions
- Make it 3 dimensional
- Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
